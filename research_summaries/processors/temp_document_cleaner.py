Temporary Document Cleaner

Clean up temporary documents that have been vectorized and are older than a specified threshold:
- Find Documents with expiration_rule=2 (temporary), is_vectorized=True
- Check if upload_date is older than the specified hours threshold
- Delete the file from OpenAI using their API
- Mark as not vectorized after successful deletion
